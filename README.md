# Note taking app

This is a note taking app inspired by the tutorial provided by [Coding In Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcxjCPeicvU&list=WL&index=38&ab_channel=CodinginFlow).

It allows a user to sign up and create, edit and delete notes. The frontend is built using React and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). The backend is Node/Express, and the notes themselves are stored using MongoDB.

You can try out the app online [here](https://www.mern-notes-radu.lol/).
